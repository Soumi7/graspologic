class SignFlips(BaseAlign):
    """
    This module is used to transform two datasets by flipping the signs of all
    entries along some dimensions. In particular, it does so in a way that
    brings these two datasets to the same orthant according to some criteria,
    computed along each dimension. The two critera currently available are the
    median and the maximum value in magnitude along each dimension.

    There are two choices for which orthant the datasets end up in: either the
    first orthant (i.e. with all criteras being positive), which is a default,
    or and orthant in which one the second dataset is already in.

    This module can also run on a single dataset. In that case it makes the
    medians / maxes of each dimension of the provided dataset positive.

    Parameters
    ----------
        freeze_Y : boolean, optional (default=False)
            For any two datasets X and Y, both of dimensions of d, there are
            2^d ways to bring their median / max signs to same orthant (one
            for each orthant). This flag chooses between one of the two options
            of how to pick such orthant.

            - True
                Acts only on matrix X (i.e. enforces Q_Y=I). In other words,
                changes the signs of X such that medians / maxes of all
                dimensions of X will match those of Y
            - False
                Makes medians / maxes of each dimension of both X and Y
                positive. In other words, brings the median / max of each
                dimension to the first orthant. Since in this case, choice of
                Q_X is independent of Y, it is not necessary to provide Y to
                fit at all.

        criteria : string, {'median' (default), 'max'}, optional
            String describing the criteria used to choose whether to flip
            signs. Two options are currently supported:

            - 'median'
                uses the median along each dimension
            - 'max'
                uses the max (in magintude) alongs each dimension

    Attributes
    ----------
        Q_X : array, size (d, d)
              final diagonal orthogonal matrix, used to modify X

        Q_Y : array, size (d, d)

        Parameters
        ----------
        X: np.ndarray, shape (n, d)
