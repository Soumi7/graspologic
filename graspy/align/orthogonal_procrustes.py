class OrthogonalProcrustes(BaseAlign):
    """
    Compute the matrix solution of the orthogonal Procrustes problem, which is
    that given two matrices X and Y of equal shape, find an orthogonal matrix
    that most closely maps X to Y.

    Note that when used to match two datasets, this method unlike
    SeedlessProcrustes, not only requires that the datasets have the same
    number of entries, but also that there is some correspondence between the
    vertices. In statistical spectral graphs, this usually corresponds to the
    assumption that the vertex i in graph X has the same latent position as the
    vertex i in graph Y.

    Implementation-wise, this class is a wrapper of the
    `scipy.linalg.orthogonal_procrustes`, which itself uses an algorithm
    described in to find the optimal solution algorithm [1]_.

    Parameters
    ----------
        freeze_Y : boolean, optional (default=False)
            Currently irrelevant since the orthogonal
            transformation always modifies only the first dataset.

    Attributes
    ----------
        Q_X : array, size (d, d)
              final orthogonal matrix, used to modify X

        Q_Y : array, size (d, d)
              final orthogonal matrix, used to modify Y
              in OrthogonalProcrustes Q_Y is always equal to identity I

        Uses the two datasets to learn matrices Q_X and Q_Y.
        In regular orthogonal procrustes Q_X is a solution to the orthogonal
        procrustes problem, and Q_Y is the identity matrix.

        Parameters
        ----------
        X: np.ndarray, shape (n, d)
            First dataset of vectors. These vectors need to have same number of
            dimensions as ones in Y, but the number of vectors can differ.

        Y: np.ndarray, shape (m, d)
            Second dataset of vectors. These vectors need to have same number
            of dimensions as ones in X, but the number of vectors can differ.
