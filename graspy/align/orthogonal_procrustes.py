class OrthogonalProcrustes(BaseAlign):
    """
    Compute the matrix solution of the orthogonal Procrustes problem, which is
    that given two matrices X and Y of equal shape, find an orthogonal matrix
    that most closely maps X to Y.

    Note that when used to match two datasets, this method unlike
    SeedlessProcrustes, not only requires that the datasets have the same
    number of entries, but also that there is some correspondence between the
    vertices. In statistical spectral graphs, this usually corresponds to the
    assumption that the vertex i in graph X has the same latent position as the
    vertex i in graph Y.

    Implementation-wise, this class is a wrapper of the
    `scipy.linalg.orthogonal_procrustes`, which itself uses an algorithm
    described in to find the optimal solution algorithm [1]_.

    Parameters
    ----------
        align_type : str, {'orthogonal' (default), 'scaling-orthogonal', 'diagonal-orthogonal'}
            Whether to perform only the regular orthogonal alignment, or a
            scaling followed by such alignment. This is commonly used in
            different test cases of the semiparametric latent position test.
            See :class:`~graspy.inference.LatentPositionTest` for more
            information.

            - 'orthogonal'
                Regular orthogonal Procrustes alignment.
            - 'scaling-orthogonal'
                First scales the two datasets to have the same Frobenius norm,
                then performs the regular orthogonal Procrustes alignment.
            - 'scaling-orthogonal'
                First scales each dimension of the two datasets to have the
                same norm, then performs the regular orthogonal Procrustes
                alignment.

        freeze_Y : boolean, optional (default=False)
            Irrelevant if the align_type is 'orthogonal', as the orthogonal
            transformation always modifies only the first dataset. In other
            cases:

            - True
                The second dataset will not be modified. The scaling, whether
                in Frobenius norm (if align_type='scaling-orthogonal'), or per
                each dimension (if align_type='diagonal-orthogonal'), will be
                applied to the first dataset in a way to match scale of the
                second.
            - True
                Both of the datasets will be scaled to have the Frobenius norm
                (if align_type='scaling-orthogonal') or the row-wise norms (if
                align_type='diagonal-orthogonal') be equal to value given by
                scale (unity by default).

        scale : int (default=1)
            Irrelevant if align_type='orthogonal', or if freeze_y=True, since
            in those cases only the first dataset is transformed. In other
            cases, this is the value to which the Frobenius norm (if
            align_type='scaling-orthogonal'), or the dimension-wise norms (if
            align_type='diagonal-orthogonal') will be equal to.

    Attributes
    ----------
        Q_X : array, size (d, d)
              final orthogonal matrix, used to modify X

        Q_Y : array, size (d, d)
              final orthogonal matrix, used to modify Y
              in OrthogonalProcrustes Q_Y is always equal to identity I
